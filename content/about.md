We are a small web development company, currently based in Brisbane. We have extensive experience in web development with a focus on Golang and Nodejs technologies.

Over the last 5 years our focus has drifted away from the more traditional dynamic server client web framework to a static site framework. Having built custom websites in Golang and Nodejs, we found our clients over whelmed with ongoing security and maintenance issues.

We now conclude for most websites that don’t require any fancy server side logic static web development is the best approach (although still possible with a static site). We even provide our clients with the source code of their site (not usual or provided at a very hefty price).

We want you to grow your business in a direction that you choose.
