## Increasing SEO

These days companies are required to be on the front page of search engines (Google) or have less than a 5% chance of gaining business through the web.

In an article by Barry Schwartz titled "Now we know: Here are Google’s top 3 search ranking factors", Barry highlights the importance of back linking. He says, Google's Andrey Lipattsev reveals links, content and RankBrain are the top three ranking signals in Google's search algorithm.

It has been well established that [RankBrain](https://searchengineland.com/faq-all-about-the-new-google-rankbrain-algorithm-234440) was said by Google to be the third most important ranking factor, but Google refused to say what the first two were. Yesterday, in a [Q&A with Google](http://webpromo.expert/google-qa-march/), Andrey Lipattsev, a Search Quality Senior Strategist at Google, said the other two factors were links and content:

I can tell you what they are. It is content. And it’s links pointing to your site.

He wouldn’t say which was more important, so the top three list now looks like this:

1 & 2: Links & Content  
 3: RankBrain

Of course, Google looks at many other factors, such as those on our [Periodic Table Of Ranking Factors](https://searchengineland.com/seotable). Links, Content and RankBrain themselves each are made up of many subfactors. But these are the overall top three, officially confirmed by Google itself.

1\. Content

2\. Links pointing to your website ([backlinks](https://www.improvemysearchranking.com/build-backlinks-to-a-new-website/))
