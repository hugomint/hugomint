SEO and optimisation to get your site noticed. A fast loading site is easier to read not only by humans but also by google bot's.

- Use only a few small images on each page and add atributes like alternate text.
- Donâ€™t use animated GIFs when a static one would have done the same job. Animations are often distracting page elements.
- **Optimise images** as much as you can.
- Leave out fancy multi media or css effects. Have your content readble and clear it's not like the front window of a butcher's shop.
- Split long pages into a few smaller ones.
