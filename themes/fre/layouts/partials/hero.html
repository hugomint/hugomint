              <h3 class="subtitle is-5 is-muted">My background includes an extensive experience in programming both front and back end design. More recently, I have been using Javascript and Golang programming languages and spinning up web servers.</h3> <h3 class="subtitle is-5 is-muted">Furthermore, I have expert knowledge in databases such as MongoDB and SQL (Structured Query Language). I have worked extensively optimizing websites for best performance and search ranking.</h3>
              <h3 class="subtitle is-5 is-bolder">The aim of Search Engine Optimization (SEO) is to improve Google search ranking which is essential to the success of any business. In my opinion, you cannot consider SEO without including Google. Over the years, I have learned that back-linking is the most important factor in improving your Google ranking (Back-linking is where another website has a link to your business website.)</h3>
              <h3 class="subtitle is-5 is-muted">These days, companies are required to be on the front page of search engines (Google), or have less than a 5% chance of sourcing business through the web.</h3>
              <h3 class="subtitle is-5 is-muted">In an article by Barry Schwartz (SEO Specialist) “Now We know: Here are Google’s top 3 search ranking factors”, Schwartz highlights the importance of back linking. He says, Google’s Andrey Lipattsev reveals that: Back-links, Content and <a href="https://moz.com/learn/seo/google-rankbrain">RankBrain</a> are the top three ranking signals in Google’s search algorithm.</h3>
              <h3 class="subtitle is-5 is-muted">It has been well established that Google attributes RankBrain as the third most important ranking factor. However, Google refused to say what the first two ranking factors were. In a Q&A session with Google, Andrey Lipattsev, a Search Quality Senior Strategist at Google, said the other two factors were; back-links and content.</h3>
              <h3 class="subtitle is-5 is-muted">There are countless articles to support this argument <a href="https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3A__www.improvemysearchranking.com_googles-2Dtop-2D3-2Dsearch-2Dengine-2Dranking-2Dfactors-2Drevealed_&d=DwIFaQ&c=HewDBbpecYK86KWBb8Fx0DnzxvObmqf6JAhppYEfnqk&r=Y6E1a0ucn7gWLzLHyBmukpDp7Pcc_jBgUcuSkDPGUYM&m=JndNWSoAR2B3umQ4RSM_GNbFH3fAIAXfw29DyCrWkpw&s=a479VE2qYzyIqNdyX2epaCkHn4oDHUu_mBBmxRpcUs0&e=">such as this article.</a></h3>
              <h3 class="subtitle is-5 is-muted">In my research most articles conclude: content, back-links, freshness, mobile first, page speed, schema code, domain and HTTPS rank in the top categories.</h3>
              <h3 class="subtitle is-5 is-bolder">In light of all this evidence, I'm pleased to offer an exclusive SEO package that produces a new website every week for your business.</h3>
